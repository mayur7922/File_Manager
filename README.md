File Manager

File management system refers to the process of organizing, storing, retrieving, and managing files and directories on a storage device. 

It involves defining how data is structured and accessed, handling file operations (such as creating, deleting, and moving files), and maintaining the overall hierarchy and integrity of the directory structure.

For the current scope, i have developed a File Manager that provides functionalities such as mentioned below:

1. Add a file/folder to a given folder

2. Move files from one folder to another

3. List all files/folder for a given folder

4. Search by file names in a folder
    
    4.1 Exact name match
